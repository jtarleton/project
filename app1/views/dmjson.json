In this ethos, a gentleman was one who became an all-rounder, not the best at one specific thing. There was also a prevailing concept of fairness, in which practicing or training was considered tantamount to cheating.[127] Those who practiced a sport professionally were considered to have an unfair advantage over those who practiced it merely as a hobby.[127]\"","comments":[],"likes":[],"location":{"name":"Astoria, NY"},"user":{"username":"jtarleton","display_name":"James T.","photo_url":"http://s2.dmimg.com/pictures/users/268347/1347766031_avatar.jpg","url":"http://www.dailymile.com/people/jtarleton"}},{"id":21247438,"url":"http://www.dailymile.com/entries/21247438","at":"2013-03-03T12:22:39Z","message":"Moving to a new Xen VPS in SoHo.
