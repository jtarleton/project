I find myself going down that route, and I already know it is not worth it; most *progressive* companies (which I hear are great to work for) are not oblivious to this fact.  Personally I would prefer to kive in a homeless shelter than be chronically constipated, (still) sleep-deprived, riddled with atherosclerotic plaque, obese or at-risk of obesity, and just generally unwell - the status quo for people who can't/choose not to exercise.","comments":[],"likes":[],"location":{"name":"Astoria, NY"},"user":{"username":"jtarleton","display_name":"James T.","photo_url":"http://s2.dmimg.com/pictures/users/268347/1347766031_avatar.jpg","url":"http://www.dailymile.com/people/jtarleton"}},{"id":20441421,"url":"http://www.dailymile.com/entries/20441421","at":"2013-01-24T12:22:55Z","message":"If anyone never saw it, here is a movie recommendation / must-see sports film: \n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Without_Limits\n\nI wouldn't call this a hardcore running flick...it's just a mainstream sports film, in the vein of \"Rocky\" or \"Field of Dreams\".
